## 👋 Welcome to my domain — I'm @hunterologist

🎯 **Offensive Security | Vulnerability Research | Red Teaming**

I specialize in discovering, exploiting, and documenting vulnerabilities across modern web stacks, APIs, and infrastructure. My approach is meticulous, data-driven, and focused on practical impact. I believe in clean code, responsible disclosure, and pushing the limits of what's possible in cybersecurity.

🚀 **Currently Diving Deep Into:**
- Advanced Web Exploitation (XSS, SQLi, SSRF, IDOR, RCE)
- Red Team Tactics & Adversary Simulation
- Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering
- Kernel-Level Vulnerability Hunting

🤝 **Let's Connect & Collaborate**
I’m open to working with researchers, engineers, and security teams on high-impact offensive security projects. Whether it’s an open-source challenge or a stealth engagement, let’s make it count.
